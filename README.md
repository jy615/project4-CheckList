# :pencil2: :page_facing_up: CheckList
CheckList is user-friendly app where users can create profile, log in and do checklist for patient before a procedure starts

## Motivation
Loss of paper records which leads to data breach are often heard in hospital. Paper-based records, rather than electronic records, 
comprised 65% of hospital data breaches. So digitization of daily operations will help to automate the processes that the staff
dont need to worry about it and can focus their efforts on tending to the patients.

## User Journey
As a user, I would like to:

1. Create an account and profile
2. Log In
3. Read the patient list overview
4. Do a checklist for the patient
5.
