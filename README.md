# :pencil2: :page_facing_up: CheckList
CheckList is an user-friendly app where users can create profile, log in, make a checklist and update procedure information for a patient before procedure starts

## Motivation
Loss of paper records which leads to data breach are often happening everywhere. Paper-based records, rather than electronic records, 
comprised 65% of hospital data breaches. So digitization of daily operations will help to automate the processes so that the staff
don't need to worry and can focus their efforts on tending to the patients.

## User Journey
As a user, I would like to:

1. Create account and profile
2. Log In
3. Read the patient list overview
4. Do a checklist for the patient
5. Update date, time or procedure if patient is unfit 
6. Delete patient list if patient is not for the procedure
